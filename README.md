# my_linkedin_banner

Instead of image editing apps, I decided to design [my linkedin account](https://linkedin.com/in/amirabbas14/) banner in flutter.

# Why?
* ✅ Easy item positioning vs apps like photoshop 
* ✅ Easy to use glass effect with only one widget, [BackdropFilter](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/BackdropFilter-class.html)
* ✅ Easy to change everything with only editing some texts, no need to open heavy image editing apps
* ✅ Easy to edit icon styles, no need to edit every single item manually

# Result
